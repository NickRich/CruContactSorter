C# Contact Sorter for Cru Contact Cards
This is a Contact Sorter for Purdue Cru Contact Cards.

The algorithm works by processing existing contacts in a text file for each target area, putting them in a List,
adding new ones from New_Contacts.txt,
sorting contacts for each target area by room #,
writing the new lists to Excel files and to the existing text files.

TODOs:
Try to make more robust, feel like a lot of values are hard-coded.
Change how Excel files are saved.
